The role of this project is to integrate the webhooks of various platforms, such as GitHub, Slack, etc., and forward
them to the integration platforms of different platforms, such as IFTTT, Discord, Wecom Bot, etc.

## <img src="https://media.tenor.com/SNL9_xhZl9oAAAAj/waving-hand-joypixels.gif" width="25px"> Welcome

Welcome to Sickle, a project for unifying webhooks, this project is just started, developed in Go language, you can find
some useful information here. If you have any questions, please feel free to file an issue. Or contact me by
email: [Pama Lee](mailto:pama@pamalee.cn)

## Function

- Support multiple webhooks sources and target platforms
- Support for customizing the format and content of webhooks
- Support for filtering and transforming data from webhooks
- Support logging and error handling

## Install

You can clone this repository to your local with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pama-Lee/Sickle.git
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## configuration

1. Use the config file to configure

You can configure your webhooks source and target platform in `./config/{project}.json`, for example:

```json
     {
  "name": "Webhook 1",
  "url": "",
  "uuid": "",
  "source": {
    "type": "source_platform",
    "config": {
      "events": [
        {
          "name": "event1",
          "key": "data. event. event_name",
          "destinations": [
            "destination_platform_1"
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "event2",
          "key": "data. event. event_name",
          "destinations": [
            "destination_platform_1"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "destinations": [
    {
      "name": "destination_platform_1",
      "type": "destination_platform_1",
      "config": {
        "webhook_url": "https://destination1.com",
        "data": {
          "custom": "${data. event. data. value1}",
          "custom2": "${data. event. data. value2}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### Configuration instructions

<mark>Is planning to make an online configuration generator</mark>

> Description of the data keys included below: You can view the data keys of your webhooks
> in `./config/{UUID}_json.json`. This file is automatically generated from the request body when the first webhooks
> arrive to help you locate the data. If your webhooks have not arrived, you can use the following example reference

For example, if your webhook request body looks like this:

```json
{
  "event": {
    "event_name": "event1",
    "data": {
      "value1": "value1",
      "value2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
```

Then your `./config/{UUID}_json.json` file will look like this:

```json
{
  "event.event_name": "event1",
  "event.data.value1": "value1",
  "event.data.value2": "value2"
}
```

> You can view the data keys of your webhooks in `./config/{UUID}_json.json`.

> Instructions for locating event data: If the event is included in headers, use `sickle.headers.{header name}` to
> locate the data, otherwise directly use the data in `./config/{UUID}_json.json` key to locate the data.


The following is a detailed description of the configuration file:

- `name` (string): The name of the webhook.
    - `url` (string): The generated webhook URL after running.
    - `source` (object): Specifies the source platform configuration for the webhook.
        - `type` (string): Specifies the type of source platform.
        - `config` (object): Configure details of the source platform, including event and target configuration.
            - `events` (array): A list containing one or more events. Each event object includes the following
              properties:
                - `name` (string): The name of the event.
                - `key` (string): The keyword of the event (check it in `./config/{UUID}_json.json`, used to locate the
                  data of the event, if the event is included in the headers, use `sickle. headers.{header name}` to
                  locate the data).
                - `destinations` (array): A list of destination platforms to send the event to when it fires.
    - `destinations` (array): A list containing one or more target platforms. Each target platform object includes the
      following properties:
        - `name` (string): The name of the target platform.
        - `type` (string): The type of target platform.
        - `config` (object): configuration information for the target platform, including webhook URL and custom data.
            - `webhook_url` (string): The webhook URL for the target platform.
            - `data` (object): custom data object.
                - `custom data name` (string): The value of the custom data. You can use `${incoming data key}` to refer
                  to the data of the source platform, and the data key of the specific source platform can be viewed
                  in `./config/{UUID}_json.json`.
                - `custom data name 2` (string): The value 2 of the custom data.
